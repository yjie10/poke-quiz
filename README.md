# poke-quiz

A tiny TypeScript CLI quiz that reveals your Pokémon profile of the day!  
Answer a few questions, summon a matching Pokémon based on your personality traits, and discover your hidden Terastal type. ✨

🔁 Even if you answer the same way every time, _randomness_ still plays a role — so you may not get the same Pokémon twice!

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- Node.js
- PokéAPI (https://pokeapi.co)

# 🚀 Getting Started

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed.

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yjie10/poke-quiz.git
$ cd poke-quiz
$ npm install
```

Run the quiz:

```bash
npm start
```

> 💡 You can also use `pnpm` or `yarn` if you prefer. It should work the same.

Then follow the prompts in your terminal! 🐾

- Designed to be short and replayable!

# 💬 About

This mini project was made for practicing TypeScript and having a little fun along the way.

There's plenty of room for improvement -- better modularity, maybe even a UI version someday. But for now, it lives as a simple and nostalgic terminal experience.

_(Might come back someday with a pixel-art interface… who knows?)_
